Enabling the Pipeline Build Action on your XNAT Data Type

This step only needs to be performed once for each data type, and does not need to be redone for any new pipelines.

In order for your users to run pipelines on an image session through the XNAT UI, an XNAT Administrator must explicitly add the PipelineScreen_launch_pipeline action to the actions menu of the report page for that image session's data type.

1. Go to Administer > Data Types to get started.

2. Click on the data type element ID that you wish to modify. (For an MR Session, click on xnat:mrSessionData)

3. A modal screen will open displaying all of the XNAT configuration, report, and security settings for that data type. Click Edit in the top right corner of the modal.

4. The modal will now display editable fields for each of these components. Navigate to Available Report Actions and add the following values (other values can be left blank):

Name: PipelineScreen_launch_pipeline

Display Name: Build

Popup: always

Secure Access: edit
