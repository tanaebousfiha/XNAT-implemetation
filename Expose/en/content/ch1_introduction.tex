\section{Introduction}

In clinical care, a huge amount of data is fabricated and stored daily. 
Despite the wealth of this data, studies by 
Jensen et al.~(2012)\cite{jensen_mining_2012} 
and Rumsfeld et al.~(2016)\cite{rumsfeld_big_2016} 
have shown that this clinical data is often stored in fragmented systems.  
Similarly, Shah et al.~(2012)\cite{shah_coming_2012} pointed out that 
investigating these databases could accelerate biomedical discoveries, and storing this data in one place and analyzing it promises great potential.



In light of this, we can cite the Extensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT)~\cite{marcus_extensible_2007}, since XNAT provides efficient storage for medical data and biosignals, which supports the Somnolink project~\cite{internetredaktion_somnolink_nodate}. While improving diagnosis and therapy of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a primary goal, ensuring interoperable sleep data exchange is an additional priority.

Medical imaging platforms like XNAT\footnote{https://www.xnat.org/{last acceed 01.09.2025}} facilitate centralized storage and visualization of patient data, with integrated tools for dataset exploration. However, automated data analysis especially using machine learning remains limited. This work prototypes direct ML model execution in XNAT to streamline deployment and improve accessibility.
