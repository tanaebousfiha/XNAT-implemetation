I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Mr. Philip Zaschke, for his support and consistent feedback throughout the writing of my bachelor's thesis. His meticulous attention to detail has greatly shaped the quality of this work. His contributions extended beyond feedback, as he generously shared his expertise and provided invaluable guidance throughout the entire process.

I also wish to express my appreciation to Prof. Dr. Grothausmann for offering the BaMa seminar, which provided valuable feedback that enhanced the quality of my work.

I extend my sincere gratitude to Mr. Christoph Jensen for his generous sharing of expertise and experience. His insightful feedback on my writing was invaluable to this work.


The following software's were used in this thesis: \\ 
I have used the HAWKI and CHATGPT for correcting grammatical mistakes, shorten long written parts. Valuable ideas was with these software also provided.
The use of Stack Overflow for obtaining valuable answers that supported my learning and use of LaTeX.

To create vector graphics, I initially used draw.io, as it made creating diagrams and schematics much easier. I then exported the diagrams as SVG files. However, since ShareLaTeX did not accept the SVG files exported from draw.io, I downloaded the diagrams as PDFs in Inkscape and obtained the PDF and LaTeX code for better illustration quality.
