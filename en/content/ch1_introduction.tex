\ac{AI} holds significant promises in healthcare. Successful implementation of artificial intelligence could ease clinician's workload, enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable the patient to take more control of their healthcare, thereby reducing preventable hospital admissions~\cite{aung_promise_2021}. XNAT is an open-source platform for storing, managing, and analyzing imaging data~\cite{xnat_about}. Its facilitates quality control processes and ensures secure data access and storage~\cite{marcus_extensible_2007}. In the Somnolink project, XNAT stored interoperable sleep data exchange to improve \ac{OSA} from diagnosis to therapy~\cite{krefting_somnolink_2025}.
Studies on AI tools in clinical research often emphasize particular technical infrastructures, neglecting generalizable implementation strategies within data platforms. For instance, by combining NVIDIA’s Clara Deploy with a customized XNAT, Hawkins et al. (2023)~\cite{hawkins_implementation_2023} showed how machine-learning pipelines can be integrated into clinical workflows. This approach transformed XNAT into an active hub for pipeline analysis, with results and clinician feedback stored in XNAT. Building on this, Satrajit Chakrabarty et al.~\cite{chakrabarty_deep_2023} presented an end-to-end framework capable of automating \ac{MRI} scan classification and tumor segmentation using AI-based methods in neuro-oncology studies. While AI integration is technically feasible, current examples often lack generalizable implementation strategies. \\
The bachelor thesis provides a comprehensive analysis of the Docker container approach within XNAT. This includes identifying the advantages, limitations, and future development potential. The relevance of this method will also be demonstrated through its application in the Somnolink project, giving a particular attention to sustainability aspects such as the FAIR guiding principles. Furthermore, a comparative analysis will be conducted with the alternative Pipeline approach. Focusing at first how the method is working and exposing the efficiently or the limitations and the negative or the positive point of this method, including the future development potential. A User Guide is developed with details, with the aim of providing the user with clarity and an instruction manual.
