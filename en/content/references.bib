	abstract = {The Extensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT) is a software platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for neuroimaging and associated data. In particular, XNAT enables qualitycontrol procedures and provides secure access to and storage of data. XNAT follows a threetiered architecture that includes a data archive, user interface, and middleware engine. Data can be entered into the archive as XML or through data entry forms. Newly added data are stored in a virtual quarantine until an authorized user has validated it. XNAT subsequently maintains a history profile to track all changes made to the managed data. User access to the archive is provided by a secure web application. The web application provides a number of quality control and productivity features, including data entry forms, data-type-specific searches, searches that combine across data types, detailed reports, and listings of experimental data, upload/download tools, access to standard laboratory workflows, and administration and security tools. XNAT also includes an online image viewer that supports a number of common neuroimaging formats, including DICOM and Analyze. The viewer can be extended to support additional formats and to generate custom displays. By managing data with XNAT, laboratories are prepared to better maintain the long-term integrity of their data, to explore emergent relations across data types, and to share their data with the broader neuroimaging community.},

Mining of electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential for establishing new patient-stratification principles and for revealing unknown disease correlations. Integrating EHR data with genetic data will also give a finer understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships. However, a broad range of ethical, legal and technical reasons currently hinder the systematic deposition of these data in EHRs and their mining. Here, we consider the potential for furthering medical research and clinical care using EHR data and the challenges that must be overcome before this is a reality.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to healthcare problems have shown enormous potential to alleviate the burden of health services worldwide and to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of predictions. In particular, developments in computer vision are creating a paradigm shift in the analysis of radiological images, where AI tools are already capable of automatically detecting and precisely delineating tumours. However, such tools are generally developed in technical departments that continue to be siloed from where the real benefit would be achieved with their usage. Significant effort still needs to be made to make these advancements available, first in academic clinical research and ultimately in the clinical setting. In this paper, we demonstrate a prototype pipeline based entirely on open-source software and free of cost to bridge this gap, simplifying the integration of tools and models developed within the AI community into the clinical research setting, ensuring an accessible platform with visualisation applications that allow end-users such as radiologists to view and interact with the outcome of these AI tools.},

	volume = {12469},
	issn = {0277-786X},
	doi = {10.1117/12.2647656},
	abstract = {Modern neuro-oncology workflows are driven by large collections of high-dimensional MRI data obtained using varying acquisition protocols. The concomitant heterogeneity of this data makes extensive manual curation and pre-processing imperative prior to algorithmic use. The limited efforts invested towards automating this curation and processing are fragmented, do not encompass the entire workflow, or still require significant manual intervention. In this work, we propose an artificial intelligence-driven solution for transforming multi-modal raw neuro-oncology MRI Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data into quantitative tumor measurements. Our end-to-end framework classifies MRI scans into different structural sequence types, preprocesses the data, and uses convolutional neural networks to segment tumor tissue subtypes. Moreover, it adopts an expert-in-the-loop approach, where segmentation results may be manually refined by radiologists. This framework was implemented as Docker Containers (for command line usage and within the eXtensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit [XNAT]) and validated on a retrospective glioma dataset (n = 155) collected from the Washington University School of Medicine, comprising preoperative MRI scans from patients with histopathologically confirmed gliomas. Segmentation results were refined by a neuroradiologist, and performance was quantified using Dice Similarity Coefficient to compare predicted and expert-refined tumor masks. The scan-type classifier yielded a 99.71\% accuracy across all sequence types. The segmentation model achieved mean Dice scores of 0.894 (± 0.225) for whole tumor segmentation. The proposed framework can automate tumor segmentation and characterization - thus streamlining workflows in a clinical setting as well as expediting standardized curation of large-scale neuro-oncology datasets in a research setting.},

Blockchain offers decentralized, tamper-proof data storage, while AI enhances predictive analytics, decision-making, and operational insights, creating a synergistic framework. Moreover, the chapter discusses the technical, ethical, and regulatory barriers to adoption and anticipates future advancements, such as explainable AI (XAI) and hybrid blockchain networks, that promise to elevate healthcare innovation.
